		<h3 id="quickstart"><strong>A) Quick Start Guide</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>To install the complete script including the image uploader (as seen in the <a href="http://www.imagetoascii.com/">demo</a>), all you have to do is upload all the files that came with this package to your webserver. Once you have done this, the image uploader page will appear on the index.php file. Example: http://www.yoursite.com/index.php</p>
<p>That's it! There's no reason to read any further unless you want to use the more advanced applications of this script. Everything after this will require some basic knowledge of HTML tags.</p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="uploading"><strong>B) Uploading Images</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>To use the image uploader located in "index.php", first boot up the page (like in the <a href="#quickstart">example</a> above), click on the "Browse" button to browse your computer for an image to be converted to ASCII characters.</p>
<p>All uploaded images will be automatically stored in the /uploads/ directory on your web server. To delete all of these images automatically, see <a href="#deleting">Deleting Images</a>.</p>
		
		<hr>

		<h3 id="deleting"><strong>C) Deleting Images</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>To automatically erase all images located in the /uploads/ directory, just run "cleanup.php" from wherever you uploaded the files to. <b>Example:</b> Type "http://www.yoursite.com/cleanup.php" into your browser. If the file has ran successfully, a message saying "All images deleted!" should show up.</p>

		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="converting"><strong>D) Manually Converting Images</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>If you would like to convert images for yourself on your web pages without the uploader, this will require some <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp" target="_blank">minor knowledge of HTML</a>. First, we need is to call on the "imgtoascii.min.js" file located in the /lib/ folder. To do this, copy and paste this code between your &#60;head&#62; tags:</p>
		<p><pre>&#60;script type="text/javascript" src="lib/imgtoascii.min.js"&#62;&#60;/script&#62;</pre></p>
		<p>Now we need to call on the script in our &#60;img&#62; tags by adding the attribute asciify="true" inside the tag, like so:</p>
		<p><pre>&#60;img src="img/yourimage.jpg" asciify="true" /&#62;</pre></p>
		<p>You can control the resolution with the attribute asciiresolution=(low/medium/high) and the color with the attribute asciicolor=(true/false). So if we wanted a high resolution image with color, the code would be:</p>
		<p><pre>&#60;img src="img/yourimage.jpg" asciify="true" asciiresolution="high" asciicolor="true" /&#62;</pre></p>

		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="trouble"><strong>E) Known Issues</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<ul>
		<li>The only major known issue is with Internet Explorer. At the moment, the script does not work with IE and there is no way to fix that due to the lack of support for the getImageData function. I have included a simple PHP script in "index.php" that will detect if the browser is IE and ask them to switch to another browser. If compatibility with IE ever improves I will update the script to support IE.</li>
		<li>There is a minor issue dealing with poorly compressed PNG files. The image will still be displayed but with the top few characters saying "undefined". I haven't found a workaround for this yet, but most properly formed PNG files will work just fine. The ones that don't will still be displayed minus a few pixels.</li>
		</ul>
